## AWS Global Infrastructure

**Regions:**

- Based in a specific geographic region
- Made up of two or more Availability Zones (AZâ€™s)
- Offers a specific subset of AWS services

**Availability Zones**

- Made up of one or more data centers
- Low latency communication between availability zones
- Designed to isolate any failure to a single availability zone

**AWS Edge Locations**

- Used as nodes of a global content delivery network
- Allows AWS to serve content from locations closest to users
- Primarily used by Amazon CloudFront and related services

## Shared Responsibility Model

> Security and Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer.

**Security of the cloud - AWS**

- [ ] Access & **Training** for Amazon Employees
- [ ] Global Data Centers & Underlying Network
- [ ] Hardware for Global Infrastructure
- [ ] Configuration Management for Infrastructure
- [ ] Patching Cloud Infrastructure & Services

**Security in the cloud - Customer**

- [ ] Individual Access to Cloud Resources & **Training**
- [ ] Data Security & Encryption (both in transit and at rest)
- [ ] Operating System, Network, and Firewall Configuration
- [ ] All Code Deployed onto Cloud Infrastructure
- [ ] Patching Guest OS and Custom Applications

## Economics of Cloud

**Capitalized Expenditure (CapEx)**

> When building a data center, an organization invests in upfront costs for the building, servers, and supporting equipment. 
> This type of expense to attain a fixed asset is referred to as a Capitalized Expenditure or CapEx.
> 

**Operating Expenditure (OpEx)**

> The regular day to day expenses of a business are considered Operating Expenditures or OpEx. After theinitial build of a data center, ongoing connectivity, utility, and maintenance costs would be considered OpEx.

## Architecture on AWS

### **Well Architected Framework**

The Well Architected Framework is a collection of best practices across five key pillars for how to best create systems that create business value on AWS.

**Operational Excellence**
Running and monitoring systems for business value
**Security**
Protecting information and business assets
**Reliability**
Enabling infrastructure to recover from disruptions
**Performance Efficiency**
Using resources efficientlyto achieve business value
**Cost Optimization**
Achieving minimal costs for the desired value

Remember the Pillars => **O**pen **S**ource **R**equires **P**ersonal **C**ommitment

### **Reliability on AWS**

#### **Fault Tolerance**
Being able to support the failure of components within your architecture


#### **High Availability**
Keeping your entire solution running in the expected manner despite issues that may occur

### **AWS Disaster Recovery Approaches**
